VIDEOFACE DIGITISER

INTRODUCTION.
The VIDEOFACE DIGITISER is compatible with ANY Spectrum. It is very easy to 
use, fully menu-driven and with screen prompts. To achieve the best possible 
results and to minimise any difficulties you may encounter, please read the 
MANUAL thoroughly.

INSTALLING THE VIDEOFACE.
1) Disconnect the power supply from your Spectrum.
   NEVER ATTACH/REMOVE THE VIDEOFACE WHEN THE SPECTRUM IS ON!
2) Insert the phono plug of your video lead into the left side socket of the 
VIDEOFACE.
   Turn the power of your TV or VCR ON at this stage, as power switching 
ON/OFF of other devices is known to be able to CRASH the Spectrum.
3) Push the VIDEOFACE firmly onto the Spectrum Extension Bus.
4) Connect the power supply and switch the Spectrum ON.
5) Insert the tape with the VIDEOFACE label facing up into your tape 
recorder, type LOAD "" and start the tape recorder. The loading is complete 
when a menu appears.
   Provided the GREEN LED on the VIDEOFACE is ON, you are READY TO DIGITISE!

Should you encounter any problems, please READ CAREFULLY the whole manual, 
ensure that all the connections are good and try again. If you still should 
not succeed, please do NOT return the VIDEOFACE, but contact our technical 
dept. Instead - we should be able to solve most of the problems over the 
phone on: 081-200 8870

Note for programmers on the VIDEOFACE SOFTWARE.
The software consists of BASIC and m/code starting at 63232. It is not 
protected and can be copied (to disk, cartridge, etc.). The m/code part 
handles all real-time hardware procedures. The menu and SAVE instructions 
are in BASIC and can thus be altered.
The area between BASIC and m/code is used for storing the latest six 
screens. By switching the ANIMATION OFF (see further), you could use this 
area for other purposes

GENERAL TIPS.
Whilst the VIDEOFACE can produce black & white screens only, best results 
may come from a colour source. The colours are transformed into grey scale 
patterns giving a nice appearance. The grey scale can also be influenced by 
the amount of lighting when using a VIDEO CAMERA - please experiment whilst 
changing the contrast on the VIDEOFACE at the same time. Always try to feed 
the VIDEOFACE with a clear and steady signal.

GETTING THE RIGHT SIGNAL.
VIDEOFACE takes pictures from any video source and digitises them by 
converting the analogue pictures into pixels. To start with, it is 
absolutely essential to feed your VIDEOFACE with the right signal - the 
COMPOSITE VIDEO - which can be found on:

1) VIDEO CAMERAS. Usually, it is very easy to get the signal from VIDEO 
CAMERAS.
   The composite video should always be available and it is just a question 
of having the right lead; most cameras actually come with a lead giving a 
composite video on a PHONO (also called RCA or CINCH) plug and that is all 
you need.

2) VIDEO RECORDERS. Most VIDEO RECORDERS should provide composite video.
   However, it is very common to mistake the UHF signal (labelled TV OUT or 
similar - it's simply the signal going from the Video recorder to TV) for 
the composite video.
   The UHF signal is utterly USELESS for digitising and you have to look for 
the VIDEO OUT signal. It can be available on either a:
   a) PHONO socket - the most typical socket used on HI-FI
   b) BNC bayonet screw-on type socket
   c) a big rectangular SCART/EUROCONNECTOR 21-pin socket
   d) a 6-pin round DIN type AV socket
   Ideally, your video will have the lead you require - you need a phono 
plug labelled (COMPOSITE) VIDEO irrespective of what the other end is or 
what else may also be on the cable (AUDIO, etc.). Any HI-FI dealer will have 
a phono-to-phono cable, but you may need to go to a VIDEO shop for any of 
the other 3 cables - make sure you know the exact make of your video 
recorder or take the manual with you. You should always be able to obtain 
the cable you need as they are all standard ones.
   VIDEO RECORDERS can be used in three ways:
   a) as a passive TUNER - i.e. just receiving UHF signal and converting it 
into COMPOSITE VIDEO
   b) in STILL mode - by freezing a picture on the video recorder, you can 
ideally adjust the contrast on the VIDEOFACE
   c) in PLAY mode - moving picture are no problem for the VIDEOFACE because 
of its high scanning speed

3) TV TUNERS. TV's are usable ONLY if they provide COMPOSITE VIDEO signal.
   Please look for the connections/cables as described under VIDEO 
RECORDERS.

4) COMPUTERS may give you a COMPOSITE VIDEO signal directly and you can just 
bring a phono plug, if available, into the VIDEOFACE. Alternatively, you may 
need to use a TV or VCR to convert a UHF signal into COMPOSITE VIDEO by 
plugging the aerial lead from the computer into your TV or VCR and then 
taking the usual COMPOSITE VIDEO signal for the VIDEOFACE.

In all cases, a GREEN LED in the VIDEOFACE MUST BE LIT and it lights up as 
soon as the COMPOSITE VIDEO signal is provided.

USING THE VIDEOFACE - THE MENU

'Z' or 'SPACE' - STOP  SCANNING
'Q' or 'P'     - START SCANNING
'S' = SAVE SCREEN$ 1-6 OR ALL
'C' = COPY
'E' = EXIT TO MENU
'0' = STEP SCREEN$
'5' = MOVE SCANNING LEFT
'6' = MOVE SCANNING RIGHT
'7' = MOVE SCANNING UP
'8' = MOVE SCANNING DOWN

'A' = ANIMATION (6 screen$)
'F' = FAST
'S' = SLOW

AJUST LEVEL CONTROLS FOR THE BEST RESULTS
PRESS "1" = START SCANNING
      "2" = ANIMATION ON
      "3" = ANIMATION OFF

The menu is horizontally divided into three parts:
a) the top boxed part is applicable ONLY during the DIGITISING
b) the middle part (blue on colour monitors) during ANIMATION
c) the bottom part is your main starting choice, so pressing
   '1' starts scanning/digitising and the RED LED comes ON
   '2' turns the animation ON - (it is normally ON as a default)
   '3' turns the animation OFF if you wish to use the part of RAM reserved 
for animation for other purposes

To start scanning, press '1'. The next vital step is to find the right 
CONTRAST by turning the knob on top of the VIDEOFACE. Depending on your 
set-up, the contrast may range from an all-black to an all-white screen at 
the extreme knob positions. You should have no problem finding the best 
results. You can create special effects by atypical contrast.

Whilst scanning, you can shift the entire picture by using the cursor keys. 
The only other keys can use are 'z' or 'space' which will stop scanning, 
freeze the last frame and, provided the animation was ON, automatically 
retain 5 previous screen; a small sub-menu will appear with these options:
1) 'q' or 'p' to re-start scanning
2) 'e' to EXIT to the main menu to turn animation on/off
3) 's' to SAVE - again, saving is menu-driven and you can
    a) save screens INDIVIDUALLY (1-6) or ALL together (0)
    b) save to MICROdrive, OPUS, Disciple DISK or TAPE - on Spectrum + 3 the 
TAPE option will save to DISK instead, provided it is formatted with enough 
room
4) 'c' to COPY a current screen to an EPSON type printer
5) '0' to STEP manually through the 6 available screens
6) 'a' to ANIMATE the 6 screens at a speed which you can control by pressing 
'f' for faster or 's' for slower
